<h1>Austin History</h1>

<p>The city of Austin has a rich culture informed by a unique history unlike anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Written by Fred Frederson</p>

<p>Last updated: June 22, 2018</p>

<h2>Earliest Inhabitants</h2>

<p>The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around 9200 BC, based on evidence found throughout the area and especially at the much-studied Gault Archeological Site, north of the city.</p>

<img src="images/gault-site.jpg" alt="The Gault archeological site">

<p>Excavations at the Gault site</p>

<h2>Native Peoples</h2>

<p>When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in the region. Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions, few settlements were established for several centuries.</p>

<h2>Geographic Distinction</h2>

<p>Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long stable and inactive fault line, on the Colorado River. This fault divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie land to the East.</p>

			<h3>Links to other site pages</h3>
			
			<p>Over the course of this exercise, we'll take the basic HTML shown here and add additional elements to make the code more semantic and meaningful.</p>

			<p>Let's get started. On lines 3&ndash;7 of the html, there is an unordered list that contains links to other pages on the site, which serve as a menu to allow users to get around.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Wrap</strong> this unordered list in the semantic element that is for such sets of links.</p>

			<h3>Introduction of an article</h3>

			<p>Doubling back to the beginning of the article, the <code>h1</code> and first <code>p</code> (lines 19&ndash;21) serve to introduce the article's subject. We've already made use of an element that refers to introductory content for a page, but that same element can also be used for introductory content of an <code>article</code>.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Wrap</strong> the <code>h1</code> and the <code>p</code> together in the semantic element that represents introductory content for a page or an article.</p>

			<h3>Creator or creation of an article</h3>

			<p>Just below the <code>header</code> you just added, there are a couple of short paragraphs (lines 27&ndash;29) that tell us who wrote the article and when it was last updated. Similar to the last step, we've already made use of an element that refers to information about the creator or creation of a page, but that same element can also be used for creator or creation information about an <code>article</code>.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Wrap</strong> the two <code>p</code> elements together in the semantic element that represents information about the creator or creation of a page or of an article.</p>
			
			<p><em>Hint: Don't let an element's name confuse you into thinking it can only be used at a specific place in a page layout.</em></p>

			<h3>Thematically-related grouping</h3>

			<p>We've already added a lot of meaning to the structure of the HTML and we could stop here, but let's go ahead and add just a bit more.</p>
			
			<p>The part of the page about the Earliest Inhabitants (lines 35&ndash;45) can be grouped together because it shares a theme. Likewise, the part of the page about Native Peoples (lines 47&ndash;49) can also be grouped together because the heading and the paragraph share a theme.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Wrap</strong> everything related to Earliest Inhabitants (lines 35&ndash;45) in the semantic element that represents a grouping of thematically-related content. <strong>Also</strong> wrap everything related to Native Peoples (lines 47&ndash;49) in the semantic element that represents a grouping of thematically-related content.</p>
