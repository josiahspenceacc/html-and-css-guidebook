			<h3>Moving from Flow Position</h3>
			
			<p>Sometimes we want to nudge an element out of its natural position within the document flow. Let's do this in two steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Set the <code>position</code> property for the <strong>special heading</strong> so that it <strong>stays within the document flow, but can be moved based on that starting position.</strong></li>
				<li>Move the <strong>special heading</strong> <code>2rem</code> <strong>down</strong> from its <strong>top</strong> edge.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p><em>Hint: Make sure your properties are in alphabetical order.</em></p>

		</quiz-step>

		<!--Step 2-->
		<question-step :step="2" 
			v-bind:options='["The way a user navigates from page to page on a site.",
							"The way some elements stay in place on screen as the user scrolls.",
							"The behavior of elements that sit side-by-side by default and the way they flow down to a new line when needed.",
							"The default positioning behavior of elements based on whether they are block, inline, or inline-block."]'
			answer="The default positioning behavior of elements based on whether they are block, inline, or inline-block.">

			<p>What is the best definition of <strong>document flow</strong>?</p>

.special-heading {

	position: absolute;
	right: 0;
	top: 0;
}">

			<h3>Moving on the Page</h3>
			
			<p>This time, let's completely remove an element from the document flow and place it somewhere on the page. Let's do this in two steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Set the <code>position</code> property for the <strong>special heading</strong> so that it <strong>is removed from the document flow</strong> and can be positioned with regard to the <strong>page</strong> as a canvas. It should still move when the page scrolls.</li>
				<li>Place the <strong>special heading</strong> in the <strong>top-right</strong> corner of the page, with <strong>no space</strong> between it and the edge of the window.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p><em>Hint: Make sure your properties are in alphabetical order.</em></p>

		</quiz-step>

		<!--Step 4-->
		<question-step :step="4" 
			v-bind:options='["True",
			"False"]'
			answer="True">

			<p>True or False: The <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> properties can only be used in combination with the <code>position</code> property.</p>

<h1>The Time Machine</h1>

<p>The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was
expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and
his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly,
and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver
caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs,
being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat
upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought
runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in
this way&mdash;marking the points with a lean forefinger&mdash;as we sat
and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)
and his fecundity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or
two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,
they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin
upon?&rdquo; said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable
ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of
course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness <i>nil</i>, has no
real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.
These things are mere abstractions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; said the Psychologist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have
a real existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There I object,&rdquo; said Filby. &ldquo;Of course a solid body
may exist. All real things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an
<i>instantaneous</i> cube exist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Filby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real
existence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Filby became pensive. &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; the Time Traveller
proceeded, &ldquo;any real body must have extension in <i>four</i>
directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and&mdash;Duration.
But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you
in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four
dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth,
Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between
the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our
consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from
the beginning to the end of our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to
relight his cigar over the lamp; &ldquo;that . . . very clear
indeed.&rdquo;</p>'

			<h3>Moving in the Viewport</h3>
			
			<p>And now we'll try something a little more complex and position an element so that it stays in place as the page scrolls beneath it. Again, we'll do this in two steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Set the <code>position</code> property for the <strong>navigation</strong> so that it <strong>is removed from the document flow</strong> and can be positioned with regard to the <strong>viewport window</strong> as a canvas. It should remain in place when the page scrolls.</li>

				<li>Place the <strong>navigation</strong> at the <strong>very bottom</strong> of the viewport window, with <strong>no space</strong> between it and the edge of the window.</li>

			<h3>Placing Multiple Sides</h3>
			
			<p>It's nice that the navigation stays at the bottom as the user scrolls, but we can probably make it look a little nicer. Add the CSS to make the <strong>navigation</strong> extend the whole width of the bottom of the window, from the <strong>left edge</strong> to the <strong>right edge</strong>.</p>

			<p>There are multiple ways to achieve this, but you should use the technique most closely tied to the <code>position</code> property and its related properties</p>

			<h3>Setting the Canvas</h3>
			
			<p>By default, absolutely positioned elements use the <em>whole page</em> as their canvas for placement. That's what's happening to the star in the code below. But sometimes we want to place the element absolutely <em>with reference</em> to a specific parent or ancestor as the canvas.</p>

			<p>Add the CSS code to make the <strong>"card" div</strong> behave as the <strong>placement canvas</strong> for the absolutely positioned <strong>star</strong>. The star should end up in the upper-right corner of the card.</p>
